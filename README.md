This repo has guides and scripts for the mainnet nodes I run. If you want to set up your own, feel free to use anything here.

## Grand Valley

I'm Grand Valley, and I run validator nodes on a couple of mainnets. Here’s what I’m working on:

### Namada
- Running a validator on the Namada mainnet (privacy-focused blockchain).
- Public endpoints I provide:
  - RPC: https://lightnode-rpc-mainnet-namada.grandvalleys.com
  - JSON-RPC: https://lightnode-json-rpc-mainnet-namada.grandvalleys.com
  - REST API: https://lightnode-api-mainnet-namada.grandvalleys.com
  - WebSocket: wss://lightnode-rpc-mainnet-namada.grandvalleys.com/websocket
  - Indexer: https://indexer-mainnet-namada.grandvalleys.com
  - MASP Indexer: https://masp-indexer-mainnet-namada.grandvalleys.com
- If you want to delegate, you can find my validator in the Namada explorer or reach out for details.
- I keep the node monitored and updated, aiming for high uptime and quick support.

### Story Protocol
- Running a validator on Story Protocol mainnet (protocol for creative works and IP on-chain).
- Public endpoints I provide:
  - Cosmos RPC: https://lightnode-rpc-mainnet-story.grandvalleys.com
  - EVM RPC: https://lightnode-json-rpc-mainnet-story.grandvalleys.com
  - REST API: https://lightnode-api-mainnet-story.grandvalleys.com
  - Cosmos WebSocket: wss://lightnode-rpc-mainnet-story.grandvalleys.com/websocket
  - EVM WebSocket: wss://lightnode-wss-mainnet-story.grandvalleys.com
  - Peer: fffb1a0dc2b6af331c65328c1ed9afad0bf107de@peer-mainnet-story.grandvalleys.com:38656
- You can delegate to my validator or use the endpoints for your own node/app.
- I keep things stable and try to help the community where I can.

## How I Work

- I monitor all my nodes 24/7 and try to fix issues fast.
- If you have questions, want to delegate, or need help with setup, just ask.
- Everything here is based on my real configs and experience.

## Guides

Check the folders for step-by-step instructions. Scripts and endpoints are the same ones I use for my own nodes.
